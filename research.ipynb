      "enzootic bovine leukaemia (EBL), is a contagious \n",
      "disease in cattle caused by the bovine leukaemia \n",
      "virus (BLV). It belongs to the genus Deltaretrovirus \n",
      "in family Retroviridae. Retrovirus integrates into \n",
      "the host’s DNA and can lead to the development \n",
      "of lymphosarcoma, a type of cancer affecting the \n",
      "lymphatic system.\n",
      "Transmission\n",
      "Bovine leukaemia virus (BLV) primarily transmits \n",
      "through infected blood or body fluids. Transmission \n",
      "can occur during procedures like dehorning, \n",
      "castration, and vaccination if hygiene is inadequate. \n",
      "Biting insects and flies can also facilitate virus \n",
      "transmission between cattle. Infected cows may \n",
      "transmit BLV to their calves during pregnancy and \n",
      "calves can acquire the virus through colostrum \n",

      "The disease often shows no clinical signs in many \n",
      "infected cattle.  However, when clinical signs \n",

      "progression of the disease:\n",
      "In asymptomatic phase - most infected cattle do \n",

      "presenting various clinical signs, viz., enlargement \n",
      "of superficial lymph nodes near the jaw, shoulder, \n",
      "or hindquarters, progressive weight loss, and a \n",
      "noticeable decline in milk production in dairy \n",

      "Animals with BLV-associated lymphosarcoma often \n",
      "exhibit lesions in central or peripheral lymph nodes, \n",
      "leading to lymphadenopathy. Abomasal lesions can \n",

      "outflow obstruction, while extradural spinal lesions \n",

      "may result in reproductive failure or abortion, and \n",
      "lesions of internal organs typically involve the spleen, \n",
      "liver, or kidneys and ureters. Liver lymphosarcoma - \n",
      "usually asymptomatic - can lead to jaundice and liver \n",
